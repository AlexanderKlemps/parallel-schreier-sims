# Parallelized Schreier-Sims-Algorithm #

This repository contains some code implementing two approaches on parallelizing the Schreier-Sims-Algorithm in GAP.
The development and analysis of these approaches has been the subject of my bachelors thesis in 2016 which is also
located in the repository as ```ba_thesis.pdf```.

The code has been implemented using hpc-GAP, see
```
    https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/hpc/chap0.html
```

For more information on the parallelization approaches, please refer to chapter 5 of ```ba_thesis.pdf```. 
For information on how to use the code, see appendix B.
